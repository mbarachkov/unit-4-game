//game generates a random "match" number with a value of 19-120
//game generates 4 crystals with a value of 1-12
//a new match number is generated when we win or lose
//when you click a crystal it should add the previous result until it is the same as match
//if the combined clicks are more than the random result you get 1 loss
//if the combined clicks are the same as the match number you get 1 win
//each time you get a win or a loss reset the game for a new match and crystal values
